Scipt uses a webcam software to capture a rapid sequence of photos when activated by motion.
The images are compared and objects are determined through processing. The number of pixels
between the position of the objects in successive photos is calculated and then multipled by
a factor to become a velocity. The velocity is printed on the photo. Script not inteded for 
high accuracy or to bust your neighbors for speeding.
